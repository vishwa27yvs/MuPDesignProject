Logic
For start we shall use polling
For load count also we should use polling (consider debounce delay)
For stop -use interrupt
For reset also we have to use polling.
For water level (8255) use polling, check out water level sensors(ADC reqd?).
Figure out relay and how will we know that reqd water level has reached?
Depending on load count start a particular subroutine
Depending on the cycle and time, load a count, something like mode 0, so the output remains high for that much time(eg: 120s therefore load 120)
The out signal of the counters should be given to different buffers,(edge triggered, high to low when the count is over) (look for edge triggered buffers).
The out signal of counter goes to the agitator.Read chp:10 from text book for motor interfacing
In the ISR of stop interrupt, write 0 to gate signal of all counters (all other enable signals)
